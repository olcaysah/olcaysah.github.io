I am a Research Scientist at the [Vehicle and Mobility Systems Group](https://vms.es.anl.gov/){:target="_blank"} in the Transportation and Power Systems Division at Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, IL. I hold a Ph.D. degree from [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.odu.edu/cee){:target="_blank"} and Master's degree from [Department of Computational Modeling and Simulation Engineering](https://www.odu.edu/cmse){:target="_blank"} from [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, Norfolk. In addition to my MS and PhD degrees I hold an MBA degree from Strayer University. Before obtaining my high level degrees, I graduated from International Black Sea University in Tbilisi, Georgia with a bachelor degree in Industrial Engineering.

### Research Interests

Freight transportation systems model development and application, including agent-based travel demand modeling. Develop machine learning and econometrics models using truck telematics and business information data. Support case studies on the impacts of new vehicle technology or freight operations on energy, emissions, and equity. Perform data preparation and analysis of simulation results. Develop RShiny applications for the purpose of data tagging and visualizations.
