I am Computational Transportation Engineer at the [Vehicle and Mobility Systems Group](https://vms.es.anl.gov/){:target="_blank"} in the Transportation and Power Systems Division at Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, IL. I hold a Ph.D. degree from [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://www.odu.edu/cee){:target="_blank"} and Master's degree from [Department of Computational Modeling and Simulation Engineering](https://www.odu.edu/cmse){:target="_blank"} from [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/){:target="_blank"}, Norfolk. In addition to my MS and PhD degrees I hold an MBA degree from Strayer University. Before obtaining my high level degrees, I graduated from International Black Sea University in Tbilisi, Georgia with a bachelor degree in Industrial Engineering.

Following topics are the areas that I am currently working on:

   * Freight Transportation and Modeling
   * Agent-Based Simulation
   * Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAV) Technologies
   * Intelligent Transportation Systems
   * Transportation Informatics/Data Analytics
   * Transportation Simulation and Modeling
   * Transportation Safety
